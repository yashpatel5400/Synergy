{"transcript": "Well I think every year is a little bit different. You have different circumstances and I think [we've] just done a good job taking advantage of our opportunities. This is a pretty tough, mentally and physically tough team that has proven itself over the course of a long season. We're playing against a great team. This team has beaten everybody. They're just a great football team - offensively, defensively, special teams - they're well-coached. This is a great football team we're playing so we're going to have to our best game of the year. \n \nI mean I'm motivated for my teammates. I said that after the game. I think they're all the motivation that I need. It takes a lot of work to get to this point and nothing that has happened in the past is going to help us win this game. What's going to help us win this game is going through that process that we talked about and being ready to go. That's enough motivation for me. \n\nWell I'm a positive person so I just focus on all the positives. I don't get caught up in negativity and bashing other people. I'm very blessed. I get to do something I love to do, show up to work every day, play football in the National Football League and play for the Patriots. I grew up watching Joe Montana and Steve Young in the Bay Area during a great time. I've got great support from my family and great support from my friends and I love playing for this team. I'm very blessed and I try to keep a positive outlook and I try to influence people in a positive way. I try to be an encouraging person in other people's life and hopefully that wears off on my teammates. It's a tough game. There's a lot of challenges that you face and I think always focusing on what's positive has worked for me. "}
