Which you are, 99% of the time. I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings.  They have like a two-second rebound rate and your back doing the next pain in the ass thing.\"\n\nAllie: \"So what?\"\n\nNoah: \"So it's not gonna be easy. It's gonna be really hard, and we're gonna have to work at this every day but I wanna do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever. You and me, every day.  Will you do something for me? Please? Will you just picture your life for me, 30 years from now, 40 years from now? Whats it look like? If it's with that guy, go. Go! I lost you once, I think I could do it again. If I thought it's what you really wanted. But don't you take the easy way out.\"\n\nAllie: \"What easy way? There is no easy way! No matter what I do, somebody gets hurt!\"\n\nNoah: \"Would you stop thinking about what everyone wants? Stop thinking about what I want, what he wants, what your parents want.
